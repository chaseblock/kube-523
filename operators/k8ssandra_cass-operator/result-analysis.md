## Alarm 1
trial-00-0000/0001

#### oracle:
```
"[\"spec\", \"podTemplateSpec\", \"spec\", \"containers\", 0, \"resources\", \"requests\", \"ACTOKEY\"]"
```
#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy. Received:
```
"kind": null,
"last_timestamp": "2024-03-11T07:56:43+00:00",
"message": "Readiness probe failed: HTTP probe failed with statuscode: 500",
```
And in the alarm we have:
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause

This is an misoperation. The events show that the cluster did not start successfully or returns error in the healthcheck path. 
```
"create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.containers[0].image: Required value, spec.containers[0].resources.requests[ACTOKEY]: Invalid value: ACTOKEY: must be a standard resource type or fully qualified, spec.containers[0].resources.requests[ACTOKEY]: Invalid value: ACTOKEY: must be a standard resource for containers]"
```
It shows that the ACTO misconfigured the cluster by providing an invalid ACTOKEY as a standard resource for containers and causes the issue.

#### Expected behavior?
It is an misoperation and is also something evitable.


## Alarm 2

trial-00-0001/0001

#### What happened


```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause

This is an misoperation. The events show that the cluster did not start successfully or returns error in the healthcheck path. 
```
create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.volumes[4].ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.accessModes: Required value: at least 1 access mode is required, spec.volumes[4].ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.resources[storage]: Required value, spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"4\", spec.containers[1].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"4\"]
```
It shows that the ACTO misconfigured the cluster by not providing the accessModes. This is an expected behavior from the cluster. And the cluster reports its unhealthy state.

#### Expected behavior?
It is an misoperation.

## Alarm 3
trial-00-0002/0001

#### What happened

The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [1] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause

In CR, the ACTO sets the pulsarServiceUrl into this
```
pulsarServiceUrl: rirafhxnwf
```
which is unreachable as an configuration for the Pulsar service. It causes the cluster creation failure, and subsequent deletion failure. 

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 4
trial-00-0003/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [1] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
In CR, the ACTO sets the pulsarServiceUrl into this
```
pulsarServiceUrl: iizdulqrzc
```
which is unreachable as an configuration for the Pulsar service. It causes the cluster creation failure, and subsequent deletion failure. 

#### Expected behavior?
Misopertion

## Alarm 5
trial-00-0005/0004

#### oracle:

#### What happened

The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [1] ready_replicas [None]\npod: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0'
```

#### Root Cause
From the events we can find:
```
0/4 nodes are available: 1 node(s) didn't match pod affinity rules. preemption: 0/4 nodes are available: 1 Preemption is not helpful for scheduling, 3 No preemption victims found for incoming pod.
```
This is caused by the ACTO accidentally set non-matching topoogyKey for the affinity requirements as follows:
```
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - topologyKey: ACTOKEY
```
It needs to matches that of any node on which any of the selected pods is running. It causes the clusters goes unhealthy. 

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 6
trial-00-0006/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy:
```
"statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [1] ready_replicas [None]\npod: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0"
```

#### Root Cause
Similar to the previous one:
It is caused by the ACTO accidentally set non-matching topoogyKey for the affinity requirements as follows:
```
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - topologyKey: ACTOKEY
```
It needs to matches that of any node on which any of the selected pods is running. It causes the clusters goes unhealthy. 
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm


## Alarm 7
trial-00-0007/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy:
```
"statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [1] ready_replicas [None]\npod: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0"
```

#### Root Cause
Similar to the previous one; the ACTO sets the topoogyKey for the affinity requirements as follows:
```
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - topologyKey: ''
```
And it violates the requirement for the topologyKey, as it should not be empty. This raises the following events:
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Required value: can not be empty, spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Invalid value: \"\": name part must be non-empty, spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Invalid value: \"\": name part must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'MyName',  or 'my.name',  or '123-abc', regex used for validation is '([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9]')]",
```
And causes the cluster to crush inevitably.

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 8
trial-00-0008/0001

#### What happened

The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause

It misconfigured the additionaVolume as follows.
```
    additionalVolumes:
    - mountPath: kvgdwjltbd
      name: '2'
      pvcSpec:
        resources:
          requests:
            ACTOKEY: 2000m
```
It does not provide valid nmountPath and request for the additionalVolumes to the Cassandra clusters.

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 9
trial-00-0009/0001

#### What happened

The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause
It is the same as the previous one.

It misconfigured the additionaVolume as follows.
```
    additionalVolumes:
    - mountPath: rvukalacop
      name: a
      pvcSpec:
        resources:
          requests:
            ACTOKEY: 1000m
```
It does not provide valid nmountPath and request for the additionalVolumes to the Cassandra clusters.

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm. Probably add the detection for the mountpoint/paths and generate pseudo/generally used path instead.

## Alarm 10
trial-00-0010/0001

#### What happened

The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause

It misconfigured the spec.ephemeralContainers:
```
"create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.ephemeralContainers[0].startupProbe: Forbidden: cannot be set for an Ephemeral Container, spec.ephemeralContainers: Forbidden: cannot be set on create]",
```
And the INVALID_NAME did not acts here. The cluster was unhealthy since the misconfiguration of spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image, spec.ephemeralContainers[0].startupProbe, and  spec.ephemeralContainers.

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm. It is not caused by setting the invalid name, but is caused by inproperly setting spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image and  spec.ephemeralContainers[0].startupProbe.

## Alarm 11
trial-00-0011/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
It caused by the invalid configuartion of the podTemplateSpec. The use of podTemplateSpec is unrecommended by the developer due to its suspectible behavior. 
```
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      containers: []
      initContainers:
      - env:
        - name: zvnzrpdinl
          valueFrom:
            resourceFieldRef:
              divisor: 2000m
              resource: zlymlynvia
        name: wimgctlmey
```
This leads to :
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.initContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.initContainers[0].env[0].valueFrom.resourceFieldRef.resource: Unsupported value: \"zlymlynvia\": supported values: \"limits.cpu\", \"limits.ephemeral-storage\", \"limits.memory\", \"requests.cpu\", \"requests.ephemeral-storage\", \"requests.memory\"]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm. 

## Alarm 12
trial-00-0012/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```

#### Root Cause
Same as the previous one:

It caused by the invalid configuartion of the podTemplateSpec. The use of podTemplateSpec is unrecommended by the developer due to its suspectible behavior. 
```
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      containers: []
      initContainers:
      - env:
        - name: kdagujcgjc
          valueFrom:
            resourceFieldRef:
              divisor: 1000m
              resource: gfhswynukj
        name: snhuuxwuvn
```
This leads to :
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.initContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.initContainers[0].env[0].valueFrom.resourceFieldRef.resource: Unsupported value: \"gfhswynukj\": supported values: \"limits.cpu\", \"limits.ephemeral-storage\", \"limits.memory\", \"requests.cpu\", \"requests.ephemeral-storage\", \"requests.memory\"]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 13
trial-00-0014/0001
Duplicated...
#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
In CR, the ACTO sets the pulsarServiceUrl into this
```
pulsarServiceUrl: bnbegjcvga
```
which is unreachable as an configuration for the Pulsar service. It causes the cluster creation failure, and subsequent deletion failure. 
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 14
trial-00-0015/0001
Duplicated...
#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause

In CR, the ACTO sets the pulsarServiceUrl into this
```
pulsarServiceUrl: iugzfooohs
```
which is unreachable as an configuration for the Pulsar service. It causes the cluster creation failure, and subsequent deletion failure. 

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 15
trial-00-0016/0002
Duplicated...
#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO sets the topoogyKey for the affinity requirements as follows:
```
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - topologyKey: ''
```
And it violates the requirement for the topologyKey, as it should not be empty. This raises the following events:
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Required value: can not be empty, spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Invalid value: \"\": name part must be non-empty, spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Invalid value: \"\": name part must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'MyName',  or 'my.name',  or '123-abc', regex used for validation is '([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9]')]",
```
And causes the cluster to crush inevitably.
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 16
trial-00-0017/0003

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
Similar to Alarm 7
The ACTO sets the topoogyKey for the affinity requirements as follows:
```
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - topologyKey: ''
```
And it violates the requirement for the topologyKey, as it should not be empty. This raises the following events:
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Required value: can not be empty, spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Invalid value: \"\": name part must be non-empty, spec.affinity.podAffinity.requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[0].topologyKey: Invalid value: \"\": name part must consist of alphanumeric characters, '-', '_' or '.', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character (e.g. 'MyName',  or 'my.name',  or '123-abc', regex used for validation is '([A-Za-z0-9][-A-Za-z0-9_.]*)?[A-Za-z0-9]')]",
```
And causes the cluster to crush inevitably.

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm


## Alarm 17
trial-00-0018/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause

The ACTO sets the host IP of the container to ACTO key, which is not satisfy the cass-operator CR.
```
  managementApiAuth:
    insecure: {}
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: vtxpxmjtah
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3
          hostIP: ACTOKEY
          hostPort: 1
          name: ACTOKEY
          protocol: ACTOKEY
```
  
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 18
trial-00-0019/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
In the mutated CRD, the ACTO didn't specify the spec.containers[0].image's value, and caused the creation of a failed pod. 
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: spec.containers[0].image: Required value",
```

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 19
trial-00-0020/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
Similar to Alarm 17
```
  podTemplateSpec:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: ouowtyngyr
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3
          hostIP: null
          hostPort: 4
          name: ACTOKEY
          protocol: ACTOKEY
```
The ACTO doesn;t set the host IP of the container to ACTO key, which is not satisfy the cass-operator CR. And the pod creation fails.
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 20
trial-01-0000/0001

#### What happened
The cluster is unhealthy.
```
message='statefulset: cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts replicas [0] ready_replicas [None]'
```
#### Root Cause
Similar to Alarm 8
It misconfigured the additionaVolume as follows.
```
  storageConfig:
    additionalVolumes:
    - mountPath: hibtkzmudr
      name: d
      volumeSource:
        ephemeral:
          volumeClaimTemplate:
            spec:
              resources:
                requests:
                  ACTOKEY: 2000m
```
It does not provide valid nmountPath and request for the additionalVolumes to the Cassandra clusters.
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 21
trial-01-0001/0001

#### What happened
Like the previous one, it tries to mount the additionalVolume to invalid path hibtkzmudr. 
And it does not contains the required values for the spec.volumes[4].ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.accessModes.
```
 "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.volumes[4].ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.accessModes: Required value: at least 1 access mode is required, spec.volumes[4].ephemeral.volumeClaimTemplate.spec.resources[storage]: Required value, spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"4\", spec.containers[1].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"4\"]",
 ```
Causing the cluster to fail. 
```
additionalVolumes:
    - mountPath: hibtkzmudr
      name: d
      volumeSource:
        ephemeral:
          volumeClaimTemplate:
            spec:
              resources:
                requests:
                  ACTOKEY: 2000m
```

#### Root Cause
ACTO doesn't define the access modes, causing the pod creation to fail. This results in an unhealthy cluster. 

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 22
trial-01-0002/0001

#### What happened
The pod creation failed and cass-operator fails to reject this state. This leads to unhealthy cluster. 

#### Root Cause
The ACTO misdefining the spec.ephemeralContainers[0].env[0].valueFrom.resourceFieldRef.resource as 'bnfmqmgmrq', which caused the behavior above. 
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.ephemeralContainers[0].env[0].valueFrom.resourceFieldRef.resource: Unsupported value: \"bnfmqmgmrq\": supported values: \"limits.cpu\", \"limits.ephemeral-storage\", \"limits.memory\", \"requests.cpu\", \"requests.ephemeral-storage\", \"requests.memory\", spec.ephemeralContainers: Forbidden: cannot be set on create]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 23
trial-01-0003/0001

#### What happened
The same as the previous one (Alarm 22). The pod creation failed and cass-operator fails to reject this state. This leads to unhealthy cluster. 
#### Root Cause
The same as the previous one (Alarm 22). 
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.ephemeralContainers[0].env[0].valueFrom.resourceFieldRef.resource: Unsupported value: \"shgngiqfqe\": supported values: \"limits.cpu\", \"limits.ephemeral-storage\", \"limits.memory\", \"requests.cpu\", \"requests.ephemeral-storage\", \"requests.memory\", spec.ephemeralContainers: Forbidden: cannot be set on create]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 24
trial-01-0004/0001

#### What happened

The pod creation failed and cass-operator reject this state. This leads to unhealthy cluster. 
```
"message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO falsefully set the valid values for spec.containers[0].volumeDevices[0] as ACTOKEY, which cannot be found.
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.containers[0].image: Required value, spec.containers[0].volumeDevices[0].name: Not found: \"ACTOKEY\"]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 25
trial-01-0005/0001

#### What happened
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```

#### Root Cause
The mutated CRD does not provide the required key-value for the spec.containers[0].image. The causes the failure of pod creation.
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: spec.containers[0].image: Required value",
```

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 26
trial-01-0006/0001

#### What happened
The same as the previous one (Alarm 25)
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The mutated CRD does not provide the required key-value for the spec.containers[0].image. The causes the failure of pod creation.
```

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 27
trial-01-0008/0003

#### What happened
The pod creation failed, and causes the cluster stays in an unhealthy state. 
```
"message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO gives invalid volumeMounts.name. It was rejected by the operator as the updated state cannot satisfy the CR. 
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"9wo9f\", spec.containers[1].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"9wo9f\"]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 28
trial-01-0011/0001

#### What happened
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO fails to configure the spec.initContainers fields. The mutated states cannot satisify the cass-operator CR. The fieldPath is invalid. 
```
"message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.initContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.initContainers[0].env[0].valueFrom.fieldRef.fieldPath: Invalid value: \"nhiiystxvx\": error converting fieldPath: unsupported pod version: v2]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 29
trial-01-0013/0001

#### What happened
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO fails to provide a valid name for spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name. The mutated states cannot satisify the cass-operator CR.
```
  "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"u1h3\", spec.containers[1].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"u1h3\"]",
```

#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 30
trial-01-0014/0001

#### What happened
It is the same duplicated alarm as previous one (Alarm 29)
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",

trial-01-0083/0002

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as the Alarm 87.
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO sets the readinessGates.conditionType to ACTOKEY, which is not in the pod's condition list with matching type.. This configuration cannot satisfy the CR and the recreation was thus failed.         
#### Expected behavior?
Misoepration. The operator does not explicitly reject this states and it fails silently with unhealthy states.

## Alarm 89
trial-01-0084/0001

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as the Alarm 87.

## Alarm 90
trial-01-0085/0002

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as the alarm 29
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO fails to provide a valid value for spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name. The mutated states cannot satisify the cass-operator CR, which leads the operation fails.
```
  "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.containers[0].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"t0qrhaoi\", spec.containers[1].volumeMounts[0].name: Not found: \"t0qrhaoi\"]"
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 91
trial-01-0086/0001

#### What happened
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The ACTO provides some invalid configuration for 
```
spec:
  cdc:
    cdcWorkingDir: ACTOKEY
    pulsarServiceUrl: vrpbawxtdv
```
The cdcWorkingDir and the pulsarServiceUrl are both unreachable. There is not detailed description in CR for the config in cdc fields so the categorization is hard. The operator was unhealthy, but fails/unable to reject the incorrect configurations. So I propose it is a misoperation.
#### Expected behavior?
Misoperation

## Alarm 92

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as Alarm 91
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.

## Alarm 94
trial-01-0089/0001

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as Alarm 25.
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True. 
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The mutated CRD does not provide the required key-value for the spec.containers[0].image. The causes the failure of pod creation. The INVALID_NAME does not act its role here. 
```
  "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.containers[0].image: Required value, spec.containers[0].ports[0].name: Invalid value: \"INVALID_NAME\": must contain only alpha-numeric characters (a-z, 0-9), and hyphens (-), spec.containers[0].ports[0].name: Invalid value: \"INVALID_NAME\": must contain at least one letter (a-z)]",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 95
trial-01-0091/0001

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as Alarm 36.
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
It misconfigured the spec.ephemeralContainers:
```
  "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.ephemeralContainers: Forbidden: cannot be set on create]",
```
And the boolean toggle did not acts here. The cluster was unhealthy since the misconfiguration of spec.ephemeralContainers[0].image and spec.ephemeralContainers[0]
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 96
trial-01-0092/0001

#### What happened
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The INVALID NAME acts here. The pod fails since the invalid value for configmap. This operator behavior is expected. The unhealthy state is also expected as there will not be any ready node available. 
```
 "message": "MountVolume.SetUp failed for volume \"e7mavy\" : configmap \"INVALID_NAME\" not found",
```
#### Expected behavior?
False Alarm

## Alarm 97
trial-01-0093/0005

#### What happened
This is a duplicated alarm as Alarm 34.
Pod creation failed. This results in a unhealthy cluster and sets the Alarm to True.
```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The pod creation failure was expected as the ACTO provides the invalid name to the operator. Also the spec.initContainers[0].lifecycle was incorrectly set. Thus, the operator's CR cannot be satisfied and the this leads to an unhealthy state. This should be categorized as an false alarm.
```
  "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: [spec.initContainers[0].image: Required value, spec.initContainers[0].lifecycle: Forbidden: may not be set for init containers without restartPolicy=Always]",

```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
```
#### Root Cause
The pod creation failure was expected as the ACTO provides the invalid spec.dnsPolicy to the operator. Thus, the operator's CR cannot be satisfied and the this leads to an unhealthy state. This should be categorized as an false alarm.
 "message": "create Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0 in StatefulSet cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts failed error: Pod \"cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0\" is invalid: spec.dnsPolicy: Unsupported value: \"ACTOKEY\": supported values: \"ClusterFirstWithHostNet\", \"ClusterFirst\", \"Default\", \"None\"",

```
 "message": "StatefulSet acto-namespace/cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts is recreating failed Pod cluster1-test-cluster-default-sts-0",
